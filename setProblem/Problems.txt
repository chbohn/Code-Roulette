ParencodingsçLet S = s1 s2...s2n be a well-formed string of parentheses. S can be encoded in two different ways: 
q By an integer sequence P = p1 p2...pn where pi is the number of left parentheses before the ith right parenthesis in S (P-sequence). 
q By an integer sequence W = w1 w2...wn where for each right parenthesis, say a in S, we associate an integer which is the number of right parentheses counting from the matched left parenthesis of a up to a. (W-sequence). 

Following is an example of the above encodings: 

	S		(((()()())))

	P-sequence	    4 5 6666

	W-sequence	    1 1 1456


Write a program to convert P-sequence of a well-formed string to the W-sequence of the same string.çThe first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 <= t <= 10), the number of test cases, followed by the input data for each test case. The first line of each test case is an integer n (1 <= n <= 20), and the second line is the P-sequence of a well-formed string. It contains n positive integers, separated with blanks, representing the P-sequence.çThe output file consists of exactly t lines corresponding to test cases. For each test case, the output line should contain n integers describing the W-sequence of the string corresponding to its given P-sequence.

HangoverçHow far can you make a stack of cards overhang a table? If you have one card, you can create a maximum overhang of half a card length. (We're assuming that the cards must be perpendicular to the table.) With two cards you can make the top card overhang the bottom one by half a card length, and the bottom one overhang the table by a third of a card length, for a total maximum overhang of 1/2 + 1/3 = 5/6 card lengths. In general you can make n cards overhang by 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(n + 1) card lengths, where the top card overhangs the second by 1/2, the second overhangs tha third by 1/3, the third overhangs the fourth by 1/4, etc., and the bottom card overhangs the table by 1/(n + 1). çThe input consists of one or more test cases, followed by a line containing the number 0.00 that signals the end of the input. Each test case is a single line containing a positive floating-point number c whose value is at least 0.01 and at most 5.20; c will contain exactly three digits.çFor each test case, output the minimum number of cards necessary to achieve an overhang of at least c card lengths. Use the exact output format shown in the examples.
